Car Parking Space Counter
This project is a Python-based solution for counting available parking spaces in a parking lot. It leverages image processing and computer vision techniques to detect and track cars in real-time or from recorded video footage.

Features
Real-time Processing: Analyze live video feeds from cameras to detect parking availability.
Customizable Regions of Interest (ROI): Define specific areas in the parking lot for monitoring.
User-friendly Visualization: Display the number of available and occupied parking spaces.
Scalable: Adaptable to parking lots of various sizes and layouts.
Logging and Reporting: Maintain records of parking lot occupancy over time.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.8 or later
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
Any other dependencies listed in requirements.txt
Install the dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/car-parking-space-counter.git
cd car-parking-space-counter
Prepare Video Input:

Place the video file or configure the live camera feed in the project directory.
Run the Script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python parking_space_counter.py
Define ROIs:

Use the GUI provided (if implemented) or manually define the parking areas in the configuration file.
View Results:

The script will display the processed video feed with real-time parking space counts.
How It Works
Parking Lot Setup:

The program analyzes a video frame to allow the user to mark parking spaces (ROIs).
Vehicle Detection:

The script uses computer vision techniques (e.g., contour detection, background subtraction, or pre-trained models like YOLO) to detect vehicles.
Space Counting:

Each parking space is monitored to determine if it is occupied or vacant, updating the counter in real-time.
Customization
Configuration:
Modify parameters in the config.py file to customize detection thresholds, camera input, or parking lot layout.
Add Features:
Integrate additional functionalities, such as SMS notifications or cloud-based dashboards.
Challenges Addressed
Handling lighting variations and shadows in outdoor settings.
Processing multiple camera feeds efficiently.
Defining robust ROIs for irregular parking lots.
Future Enhancements
Integration with IoT sensors for enhanced accuracy.
Deploying the solution as a web or mobile app.
Using machine learning models for advanced detection.
